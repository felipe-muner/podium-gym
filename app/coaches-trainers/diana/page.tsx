              Bio
            </h3>
            <p className="mb-4 text-gray-600">
              Since Diana needs to move to be happy, she started with athletics at a very young age. Her strength was short-distance sprinting (60m / 100m), which led to her first experience with a barbell and heavier weights at just 14 years old — used to build strength and resilience for her fast sprints.
            </p>
            <p className="mb-4 text-gray-600">
              Over time, athletic competitions became less frequent, but her love for the barbell and heavy weights remained. Throughout the years, Diana focused on Powerlifting, Kettlebell Skills, and Judo — until CrossFit entered the stage. From day one, she fell in love with the world of Functional Training.
            </p>
            <p className="mb-4 text-gray-600">
              During a 2.5-year battle against aggressive cancer in 2012, she used sport and community as her medicine and source of survival. The mental strength she gained helped her so deeply that she decided to take the chance of a second life to change everything — and become a coach. Her mission: to help others stay healthy and strong, or to regain mental and physical power during or after any personal challenge.
            </p>
            <p className="mb-4 text-gray-600">
              In 2017, she fulfilled her dream of opening her own Functional Training Gym in Switzerland, which she unfortunately had to close during Covid. That&apos;s when she came to Koh Phangan — to rest, reset, and plan her next steps. Soon after, she was offered the opportunity to coach CrossFit on the island — and she still does. And much more.
